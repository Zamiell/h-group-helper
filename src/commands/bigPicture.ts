const BIG_PICTURE_TEXT = `In pickup games with members of our group, there are two axes upon which you should make decisions:

1) **Raw Value**
     - How efficient is the clue?
     - Does the clue have some side benefits that other, less-complicated clues wouldn't get?
     - Should the clue technically work according to the stated conventions?

2) **Clarity**
     - Is there a chance that a teammate could reasonably mess up from this clue, even if it should technically work?
     - What is the future-required-efficiency of the game?
     - Are efficient and/or complicated clues necessary to win? Or is it possible to win via giving simple 1-for-1s for the rest of the game?

We expect players to:
  1) carefully consider information from both of these axis
  2) combine the information together
  3) and make a decision that incorporates both parts

In your previous messages, you sound like you might be only considering information from the first axis, and not integrating information from the second axis. This could be a crucial oversight on your part. As a group, we need to get in the habit of making sure that we *win* as many games as possible, rather than trying to play as "high-value" as possible and then blaming each other in reviews for not "getting" our clues.

For more information about this, please see the *Clarity Principle* on the website: <https://hanabi.github.io/docs/level-13/#clarity-principle>
